# 🗑️ Smart Waste Management System

### Developed by **Jinal Vekariya and Team**

---

## 🌍 Overview

The **Smart Waste Management System** is a modern web-based project designed to promote efficient waste collection, management, and environmental sustainability through technology.
Built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**, this system demonstrates how **IoT and data-driven approaches** can improve urban waste management while raising public awareness.

The platform is structured as an educational and conceptual prototype — representing the potential of **smart bins**, **sensor-based monitoring**, and **automated waste collection routes** to reduce pollution and operational costs.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Traditional waste collection systems are inefficient, often leading to:

* Overflowing garbage bins
* Unoptimized waste collection routes
* Increased environmental pollution
* Lack of real-time monitoring

The **Smart Waste Management System** aims to address these problems using **smart sensors**, **data visualization**, and **intelligent route optimization** models — presented through an engaging web interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Informative Dashboard** – Displays smart waste management concepts and architecture clearly.
✅ **IoT Concept Demonstration** – Explains the use of smart bins, ultrasonic sensors, and wireless data transfer.
✅ **Modular Components** – Built using reusable React components for scalability and clarity.
✅ **Modern UI** – Tailwind CSS for responsive and attractive design.
✅ **Fast Build Tool** – Vite ensures lightning-fast development and live reloading.
✅ **Clean Architecture** – Well-organized folder structure and component hierarchy.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The conceptual architecture involves:

1. **Smart Bins** – Equipped with ultrasonic sensors to detect garbage levels.
2. **IoT Module (e.g., NodeMCU / ESP8266)** – Sends bin status data to a central server.
3. **Database / Cloud Storage** – Stores bin data and location coordinates.
4. **Web Dashboard (this project)** – Displays the status of bins and route optimization insights.
5. **Waste Collection Vehicles** – Use optimized routes based on data analytics.

*(This frontend demonstrates steps 4 and 5 visually and conceptually.)*
